Tweepsmanager
============

Tweepsmanager is a tool that lets you view and manage your twitter connections.

The main points is to let you follow/unfollow users and browse the connections of other users simply by clicking on their username.

It's a project I started to learn rails so any feedback is much appreciated

Getting Started
===============

Copy /config/keys.yml.example to /config/keys.yml and fill in the twitter api keys that you want to use.
